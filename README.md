## Cool Stuff

- Crossing under the bridges (the red lines on the curves), touching the circular assets with the star, and the buttons on the left side, add points to the score.
- The triangular assets on the top corners of the levers, add impulse to the ball, like a real pinball.
- The Highscore gets saved between games.

## Bugs

 - Removing objects between scene changes crashed the game, it got fixed with a boolean.
 - The spring was clipping with the ball, adding the Restart button it recovered the position original porision.
